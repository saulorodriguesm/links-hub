# My Links Hub 

This project was idealized only to practice some basic web development skills, but also to be my girlfriend's personalized "My Links" that people used to use in Instagram's bio. 

My intention is to evolve this one to be an open-source and free to use application where people can build this kind of links app without any payments or sponsors in the page. 

TODO: This Readme will be evolved as well.
